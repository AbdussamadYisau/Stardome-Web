Stardome is a social networking site for organizing gaming tournaments and meeting other gamers.

Stardome was created to help me get into my 100DaysofCode groove and I had actually created the UI a long time ago.

Feel free to contribute.

I will be making use of ReactJS, Sass and GoLang

# UI
Here is a link to the UI design I will be following:

NB: open in incognito mode

# Contributions
